# WhatsApp API - Database Error Fixes Applied

## Issues Addressed

### 1. SQLite Parameter Limit Error ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `D1_ERROR: too many SQL variables at offset 341: SQLITE_ERROR`

**Root Cause**: The code was attempting to use too many SQL parameters in a single query, exceeding SQLite's limit of 999 parameters.

**Solution Applied**:
- Reduced `CHECK_BATCH_SIZE` from 400 to 150 (well below the 999 limit)
- Reduced `BATCH_SIZE` from 100 to 25 for database operations
- Added parameter validation to prevent exceeding limits
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging for each batch
- Added delays between batch operations to prevent overwhelming the database

### 2. Improved Error Handling ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Added detailed logging for each batch operation
- Added parameter validation with specific error messages
- Added retry-friendly error messages
- Added progress tracking during import operations

### 3. Performance Optimizations ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Reduced batch sizes for better stability
- Added small delays between batch operations
- Improved chunking strategy for existing contact checks
- Better memory management for large contact lists

## Technical Changes Made

### File: `functions/api/contacts/import.js`

1. **Chunk Size Reduction**:
   ```javascript
   const CHECK_BATCH_SIZE = 150; // Was 400
   const BATCH_SIZE = 25; // Was 100
   ```

2. **Parameter Validation**:
   ```javascript
   const totalParams = 1 + chunk.length; // 1 for userId + chunk length
   if (totalParams >= 999) {
       throw new Error(`Too many parameters in query: ${totalParams} (max 998)`);
   }
   ```

3. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Added batch progress tracking
   - Added detailed error messages for debugging
   - Added operation counters

4. **Batch Processing Improvements**:
   - Added delays between batch operations
   - Enhanced error handling for individual batches
   - Better progress reporting

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Small Scale Test**:
   - Import a small contact list (10-50 contacts) first
   - Verify the fix works correctly

2. **Large Scale Test**:
   - Test with a larger contact list (500+ contacts)
   - Monitor logs for any issues
   - Verify import completion and data integrity

3. **Error Recovery Test**:
   - Test with incomplete/duplicate contact data
   - Verify graceful error handling

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- Import operation logs for any new errors
- Performance metrics during contact imports
- Database response times
- Success/failure rates

## Additional Notes

The fixes ensure that:
- No single SQL query exceeds SQLite's parameter limits
- Large contact imports are processed in manageable chunks
- Errors are caught early and reported clearly
- The system can handle contacts lists of any size

These changes make the contact import functionality robust and production-ready.
