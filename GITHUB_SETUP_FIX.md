# GitHub Setup Fix

## Current Issue

You're encountering a GitHub permission error because the repository URL in the deployment script points to `palmiyeitadmin/whatsapp-api.git` but your GitHub username is `rifatduru7`.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Create Your Own Repository

1. **Create a new repository** on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `whatsapp-api` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "CF-Infobip Broadcaster - WhatsApp bulk messaging application"
   - Make it Public
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Update the deployment script**:
   - Edit `scripts/deploy.sh` (line 25) and `scripts/deploy.bat` (line 12)
   - Change: `https://github.com/palmiyeitadmin/whatsapp-api.git`
   - To: `https://github.com/rifatduru7/whatsapp-api.git`

3. **Deploy to your repository**:
   ```bash
   npm run git:push  # or npm run git:push:windows
   ```

### Option 2: Fork Existing Repository

1. **Fork the repository**:
   - Go to https://github.com/palmiyeitadmin/whatsapp-api.git
   - Click "Fork" button
   - Select your account as the destination

2. **Update the deployment script**:
   - Change the remote URL to your fork:
   - `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/whatsapp-api.git`

3. **Deploy to your fork**:
   ```bash
   npm run git:push
   ```

### Option 3: Contact Repository Owner

1. **Contact the repository owner** to request push access:
   - Open an issue on the repository
   - Request to be added as a collaborator
   - Or ask them to create a new repository under your account

## Updated Deployment Script

If you want to modify the deployment script to use your own repository, here's what to change:

### In `scripts/deploy.sh` (line 25):
```bash
# Change from:
git remote add origin https://github.com/palmiyeitadmin/whatsapp-api.git

# To:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/whatsapp-api.git
```

### In `scripts/deploy.bat` (line 12):
```batch
# Change from:
git remote add origin https://github.com/palmiyeitadmin/whatsapp-api.git

# To:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/whatsapp-api.git
```

## Next Steps

1. Choose one of the fix options above
2. Update the deployment script with your repository URL
3. Run the deployment command
4. Verify successful push to your repository

The rest of the project is complete and ready for deployment once you resolve the GitHub repository issue.
